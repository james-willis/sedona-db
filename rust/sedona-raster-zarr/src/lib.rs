//! Zarr-backed N-D raster loader for SedonaDB.
//!
//! Opens a Zarr group via the `zarrs` crate and emits one raster row per
//! chunk position. Each row's bands are the corresponding chunks of each
//! array in the group, mapped onto SedonaDB's canonical N-D raster Arrow
//! schema.
//!
//! Two entry points:
//!
//! - [`group_to_indb_rasters`] — eagerly fetches every chunk's bytes into
//!   the Arrow `data` column. Suitable for snapshots / small groups.
//! - [`group_to_outdb_rasters`] — emits chunk-anchor URIs only; bytes
//!   fetch on demand through the process-wide OutDb loader (registered
//!   separately via `sedona-raster`'s loader hook).
//!
//! Phase 1 supports local filesystem stores only; cloud backends arrive
//! with the resolver work.
